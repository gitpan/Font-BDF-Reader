Font/BDF/Reader version 0.01
=====================

The Font::BDF::Reader module provides an OO interface to reading a BDF file.

It has been built on Perl 5.8.0 on Linux Mandrake and tested only with
one bdf file (kanji48.bdf from the Monash University's Nihongo FTP site),
but should work with any other BDF file.

See http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/japanese.html to download the
kanji48.bdf file.

The bdf2png script, also included, breaks down a BDF file into
one PNG file per character.  The PNG file is transparent, the foreground
color black.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

To run the bdf2png script, both the Font::BDF and GD modules must
be installed.
